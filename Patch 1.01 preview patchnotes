Patch 1.01 Preview (ETA end of this week)

- Alloy quests description updated (better info on how to obtain some of the liquids required to make an alloy)
- added "quest" for update guide/patchnotes ingame (bq_admin default load command + ingame patchnotes) 
   > repeatable quest with quest reload command button
- boss loot added (Ender Dragon, Wither, etc.) This does not affect blight (normal mobs with purple flames) loot
- upgrading a Tinker tool / weapon with things like emeralds no longer increases the mining level of that tool/weapon.
- Animania: slightly tweaked configs to be more server friendly
- added quest that explains how to get vanilla torches to the Minecolonies questline.


New mods:
- item stages > using armors is now restricted to ages too
