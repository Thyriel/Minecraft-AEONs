Patch 1.01 Preview (ETA end of this week)

- Alloy quests description updated (better info on how to obtain some of the liquids required to make an alloy)
- added "quest" for update guide/patchnotes ingame (bq_admin default load command + ingame patchnotes) 
   > repeatable quest with quest reload command button
- boss loot added (Ender Dragon, Wither, etc.) This does not affect blight (normal mobs with purple flames) loot
- removed copper, lead and aluminum brass from ironage restriction (tools, weapons now useable before unlocking ironage)
- upgrading a Tinker tool / weapon with things like emeralds no longer increases the mining level of that tool/weapon.
- Animania: slightly tweaked configs to be more server friendly

New mods:
- item stages > using armors is now restricted to ages too


Maybe added:
- Added recipes to craft Animania Milk buckets to vanilla milk buckets for the pigiron alloy recipe 
   (previously required a "Cow in a Jar" to obtain vanilla milk
