Patch 1.1 Preview (ETA end of this week)

- Alloy quests description updated (better info on how to obtain some of the liquids required to make an alloy)
- added "quest" for update guide/patchnotes ingame (bq_admin default load command + ingame patchnotes) 
   > repeatable quest with quest reload command button
- upgrading a Tinker tool / weapon with things like emeralds no longer increases the mining level of that tool/weapon.
- added quest that explains how to get vanilla torches to the Minecolonies questline.
- removed PrimalCore "Stone basin" and related recipes (bug with BQM). These recipes now require Botanias Pestle & Mortar instead. 
 >>>(already hotfixed on official server)


New mods:
- item stages > using armors/shields is now restricted to ages too.


FUTURE PATCHES (not in 1.1 sorry, had to rush a bit because of the major bug with stone basin):
- boss loot added (Ender Dragon, Wither, etc.) This does not affect blight (normal mobs with purple flames) loot
- Animania: slightly tweaked configs to be more server friendly
