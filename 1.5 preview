PREVIEW PATCHNOTES 1.5 (Work in Progress - everything seen here can change)

IMPORTANT !!!!
=========================
BACKUP YOUR SAVEGAME !!!
As there where a lot of changes (and even more mods updated) i highly recommend
backing up the savegame before playing with the 1.5 patch for the first time.
=========================

- Updated almost all mods to newer versions
- removed mods: Weather2, IGCF, OpticManager
- New Mods: Extended Days, Better Fishing, JEI Villagers, Soulus (crafted spawners), Signals (Railway signaling system)

Bugfixes:
- moon no longer stuck at fullmoon (#10)
- Day/Night Cycle extension replaced by "Extended Days" mod: 
    * Days now have 18 minutes (+10 minutes night) extending the vanilla time per daycycle by a total of 8 minutes
    * Brightness is again a client side setting
- Vanilla iron sword (for upgrading the Minecolonies Barracks, see Issue #9) can now be found in dungeon level 4 chests.
- Hearts should no longer drop in mobfarms
- Blights killed by environment (e.g. mobfarms) now increase the area level


New Quests:
   * Animania: Horse Carts
   * Small questline for new mod "Better Fishing"
   * Tinker Tank
   * Mobfarms: added quests for new mod Soulus (create your own Spawners)

Roguelike Dungeons are now far more dangerous ! (Only affects newly generated dungeons)
* Mutated Mobs now spawn inside dungeons following the AEONs pattern:
   - Dungeon level 0 & 1 features Iron Age mobs
   - Dungeon level 2 features Diamond Age mobs
   - Dungeon level 3 features Obsidian Age mobs
   - Dungeon level 4 features Cobalt Age mobs
* Dungeon level 0 + 1, 2, 3 and 4 now each have their own chest loot. The deeper you go the better loot you will find.
* Added a lot of new loot to dungeon chests
* Carrying spawners has been disabled
* Note that mob spawning inside dungeons is NOT restricted by the ages you have not unlocked yet.
* If you want to manually create a dungeon (in case you already have generated almost all chunks around your base) you
    can use the "/roguelike dungeon here" command to generate a new dungeon where you stand. (DO NOT USE THIS NEAR YOUR BASE !!!)
