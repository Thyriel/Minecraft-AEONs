MORE QUESTS ! for...
- Forestry (Arboriculture, Lepidopterology, Farm)
- Botania (Flowers, Lens)
- Astral Sorcery
- fishing
- Tinker tank & IE pump

- added oreDict entries for various questitems so the quests now accept different variations of those items (e.g. Oak / Spruce / ... variants)


============================================================
A little further out (testing the possibilities / fun atm): 
maybe adding "From the Ground Up!" mod
> Basically a whole techtree. Items get unlocked by a research system.
