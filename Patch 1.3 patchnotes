- fixed some quests that accepted wrong materials (e.g. Goat quest) > NBT check removed
- Manasteel, Terrasteel, Elementium, Gaia spirit, Gaia steel and Adamantium Tinker bows / arrows / shafts now have proper stats. 
    Most of the new stats can't be applied to already crafted ones, sorry.
- Hunting quests for certain mobs now require less mobs to be killed. (and corrected those that required a 10/10/10 kill)
- added meeting quest for "the Grue" to explain what killed you in the dark (beneath dimension)
- removed resource loader mod (no longer needed with Romimoco update). 
 >> If you still have the "resources" folder you can safely delete it.
- removed some unobtainable items from the tinker smeltery. (e.g. Adamantium / Gaia steel ore)
  >> These items are only internally used to allow the creation of the corresponding liquids and should not be shown to players at all
- enabled Quark's hotkey for autojump in configs.
 > You should setup a key for that feature in configs
- updated various mods

================
NEW FEATURE:
================
- Materials (ores, ingots, etc.) from Obsidian age and higher can no longer be melted with lava as fuel in the tinker smeltery. 
   (required temperature >1000°)
- added Astral Sorcery's "Liquid Starlight" as a Tinker smeltery fuel with a temperature of 3500°. 
  > This will need quite some effort put into that mod to progress beyond obsidian age !
- added quest guiding you to the new fuel
- added Astral Sorcery questline (basic for now)
