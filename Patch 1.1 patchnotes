- Alloy quests description updated (better info on how to obtain some of the liquids required to make an alloy)
- added "quest" for update guide/patchnotes ingame (bq_admin default load command + ingame patchnotes) 
   > repeatable quest with quest reload command button
   TIPP: If you install a patch and don't see a quest there with the apropiate patchnumber you need to reload quests !
- upgrading a Tinker tool / weapon with things like emeralds no longer increases the mining level of that tool/weapon.
- added quest that explains how to get vanilla torches to the Minecolonies questline.
- Fixed a major bug that completed ALL quests when crafting a Primalcore "stone basin" 
   > Stone basin has been removed, related recipes replaced
