(more to come) WIP

- vanilla Hoe can now be crafted (fix for minecolonies farmer not working with TiC mattock)
   > note that in order to make "flaked diamond" you need a harder material then stone to punch a diamond onto
- vanilla bow / arrows can now be crafted (fixes minecolonies archers not accepting TiC bows as weapon)
   > Arrows recipe works with any TiC material that you like
Vanilla hoe/bow/arrow may be removed in a later patch if/when minecolonies allow usage of TiC mattocks / bows (requested)
- updated minecolonies, astral sorcery and animania mod
